    abstract = {Granular materials, such as sand and grains, are ubiquitous. Simulating the 3D dynamic motion of such materials represents a challenging problem in graphics because of their unique physical properties. In this paper we present a simple and effective method for granular material simulation. By incorporating techniques from physical models, our approach describes granular phenomena more faithfully than previous methods. Granular material is represented by a large collection of non-spherical particles which may be in persistent contact. The particles represent discrete elements of the simulated material. One major advantage of using discrete elements is that the topology of particle interaction can evolve freely. As a result, highly dynamic phenomena, such as splashing and avalanches, can be conveniently generated by this meshless approach without sacrificing physical accuracy. We generalize this discrete model to rigid bodies by distributing particles over their surfaces. In this way, two-way coupling between granular materials and rigid bodies is achieved.},

In this paper, we present a simulation algorithm based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) that succeeds in modeling important features of the behavior of granular materials. These features are unilateral incompressibility, friction and cohesion. We extend an existing unilateral incompressibility formulation to be added at almost no effort to an existing SPH-based algorithm for fluids. The main advantages of this extension are the ease of implementation, the lack of grid artifacts, and the simple two-way coupling with other objects. Our friction and cohesion models can also be incorporated in a seamless manner in the overall SPH simulation algorithm.},

With this approach, we avoid the computational expenses of solving a pressure Poisson equation, while still being able to use large time steps in the simulation. The achieved results show that our predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH) method clearly outperforms the commonly used weakly compressible SPH (WCSPH) model by more than an order of magnitude while the computations are in good agreement with the WCSPH results.},

Display Omitted Computing the forces acting from a surrounding air phase onto a particle-based fluid or rigid object is challenging. Simulating the air phase and modeling the interactions using a multiphase approach is computationally expensive. Furthermore, stability issues may arise in such multiphase simulations. In contrast, the effects from the air can be approximated efficiently by employing a drag equation. Here, for plausible effects, the parameterization is important but challenging. We present a drag force discretization based on the drag equation that acts on each particle separately. It is used to compute the effects of air onto particle-based fluids and rigid objects. Our presented approach calculates the exposed surface area and drag coefficient of each particle. For fluid particles, we approximate their deformation to improve the drag coefficient estimation. The resulting effects are validated by comparing them to the results of multiphase SPH simulations. We further show the practicality of our approach by combining it with different types of SPH fluid solvers and by simulating multiple, complex scenes.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel method for the robust handling of static and dynamic rigid boundaries in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. We build upon the ideas of the density maps approach which has been introduced recently by Koschier and Bender. They precompute the density contributions of solid boundaries and store them on a spatial grid which can be efficiently queried during runtime. This alleviates the problems of commonly used boundary particles, like bumpy surfaces and inaccurate pressure forces near boundaries. Our method is based on a similar concept but we precompute the volume contribution of the boundary geometry and store it on a grid. This maintains all benefits of density maps but offers a variety of advantages which are demonstrated in several experiments. Firstly, in contrast to the density maps method we can compute derivatives in the standard SPH manner by differentiating the kernel function. This results in smooth pressure forces, even for lower map resolutions, such that precomputation times and memory requirements are reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to density maps. Furthermore, this directly fits into the SPH concept so that volume maps can be seamlessly combined with existing SPH methods. Finally, the kernel function is not baked into the map such that the same volume map can be used with different kernels. This is especially useful when we want to incorporate common surface tension or viscosity methods that use different kernels than the fluid simulation.},

In this review, recent advances in SPH for simulating the multiphase flow are reviewed. Firstly, the basic concept of SPH is briefly introduced. Attention is then paid to how to treat the pressure of incompressible flow, boundary condition and the surface tension in SPH. In addition, modeling free surface flow is briefly introduced. The modified interfacial models and their applications in handling high density ratio are addressed. Finally, a summary of SPH in the application of the multiphase flow is given.}

While the solution of the PPE provides pressure at fluid samples, the embedded boundary handling does not compute pressure at boundary samples. Instead, IISPH uses various approximations to remedy this deficiency. In this article, we illustrate the issues of these IISPH approximations. We particularly derive Pressure Boundaries, a novel boundary handling that overcomes previous IISPH issues by the computation of physically meaningful pressure values at boundary samples. This is basically achieved with an extended PPE. We provide a detailed description of the approach that focuses on additional technical challenges due to the incorporation of boundary samples into the PPE. We therefore use volume-centric SPH discretizations instead of typically used density-centric ones. We further analyze the properties of the proposed boundary handling and compare it to the previous IISPH boundary handling. In addition to the fact that the proposed boundary handling provides physically meaningful pressure and pressure gradients at boundary samples, we show further benefits, such as reduced pressure oscillations, improved solver convergence, and larger possible time steps. The memory footprint of fluid samples is reduced and performance gain factors of up to five compared to IISPH are presented.},

Our method is the result of a theoretical and practical in-depth analysis of the most recent implicit SPH solvers for viscous materials. Based on our findings, we developed a list of requirements that are vital to produce a realistic motion of a viscous fluid. These essential requirements include momentum conservation, a physically meaningful behavior under temporal and spatial refinement, the absence of ghost forces induced by spurious viscosities and the ability to reproduce complex physical effects that can be observed in nature. On the basis of several theoretical analyses, quantitative academic comparisons and complex visual experiments we show that none of the recent approaches is able to satisfy all requirements. In contrast, our proposed method meets all demands and therefore produces realistic animations in highly complex scenarios. We demonstrate that our solver outperforms former approaches in terms of physical accuracy and memory consumption while it is comparable in terms of computational performance. In addition to the implicit viscosity solver, we present a method to simulate melting objects. Therefore, we generalize the viscosity model to a spatially varying viscosity field and provide an SPH discretization of the heat equation.},
